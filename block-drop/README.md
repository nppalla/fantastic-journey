# Block Drop

A falling-blocks puzzle game for the browser. It uses one `<canvas>` and plain JavaScript.

## Run

Open `index.html` in a browser. You can also serve the repository root:

```bash
npx serve .
```

## Controls

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Left / Right arrow | Move the piece |
| Space | Rotate the piece |
| Down arrow | Soft drop |
| Up arrow | Hard drop |
| P | Pause or resume |

## Rules

- Fill a full row to clear it.
- Every 10 cleared lines raises the level by one.
- Each level makes pieces fall faster.
- The game ends when a new piece cannot enter the board.

## Scoring

| Lines cleared at once | Points |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 100 x level |
| 2 | 300 x level |
| 3 | 500 x level |
| 4 | 800 x level |

A hard drop gives 2 points for each row the piece falls.

## Rendering

Restarts cancel the pending animation frame before starting a new loop, so only
one update and draw run per frame. Block gradients and glows are rendered once
per color and size into cached canvas sprites, then reused for the board,
ghost piece, and next-piece preview.

## Tests

Run the regression tests with Node.js 18 or later (no dependencies required):

```bash
node --test block-drop/game.test.js
```

Run this command from the repository root.
